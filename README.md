As the original source says,

A sentiment analysis job about the problems of each major U.S. airline. Twitter data was scraped from February of 2015 and contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service").

In this Notebook, we will go step by step from multi-class Classification perspective of these text sequences (first part). We will perform

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Preprocessing
- Basic CNN Frameworks with word embeddings, character embeddings and ensembles with LSTM
- Hidden layers visualization for CNN and plotting using PCA and TSNE
- False Positive and False Negative Analysis for CNN
- Model Explanation using SHAP for Deep Learning Models
- Model Explanation using LIME
We evaluate and understand most CNN based architectures that have been published till 2018.
